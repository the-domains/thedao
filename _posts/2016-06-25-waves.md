  WAVES is a decentralized platform ​that uses custom blockchain tokens to
  represent value. Tokens can be issued by any platform user, ​and can be
  transferred, swapped, and traded ​on​ an integrated decentralized exchange.
  Tokens may represent a share in a crowdfunding project, financial instrument,
  ​or any other ​item​ with inherent value.
